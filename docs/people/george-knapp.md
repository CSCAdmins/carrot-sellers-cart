    <div class="quote-text">
        "I'm George Knapp, Chief Investigative Reporter for KLAS-TV in Las Vegas—not a whistleblower, and not a UFO witness (as far as I can remember, that is). My pursuit of the UFO mystery—and the many rabbit holes attached to it—started in 1987, 38 years ago. Nearly every day since then, I get asked the question: Do I believe this UFO stuff? Do I believe in aliens or ETs? And my answer is no. Belief has nothing to do with it. To me, it is—and always has been—a news story."
