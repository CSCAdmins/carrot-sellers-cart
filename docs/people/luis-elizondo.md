## Paranormal Claims

In "Imminent" and interviews, Elizondo describes experiences beyond standard UAP claims:

- **Glowing Orbs**: Home "invaded" for seven years by floating, glowing green orbs "about the size of a basketball"; confirmed by wife Jennifer
- **Remote Viewing**: Trained in psychic espionage; claims it works despite CIA concluding it doesn't
- **The Hitchhiker Effect**: Claims studying UAPs attracts them to researchers
- **Brain Anomalies**: People with larger "caudate putamen" may attract UAPs and communicate with them
- **Alien Implant**: VA doctor allegedly examined implant that "tried to run" when excised

---

## Official Responses

**Pentagon/Sue Gough (2024)**:
> "Luis Elizondo had no assigned responsibilities for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) while assigned to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security."

**AARO Position**:
> "To date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently."

**DoD Inspector General (Feb 2022)**:
> Elizondo's reprisal complaint closed: "The evidence we reviewed does not support your client's reprisal complaint because no action affecting his eligibility for access to classified information was taken or threatened against him."

## The "Five Observables"

AATIP identified characteristics distinguishing UAP from known technology:

1. **Instantaneous Acceleration** - Immediate velocity changes
2. **Hypersonic Velocity** - 10,000-13,000+ mph
3. **Low Observability** - Evading radar/sensors
4. **Trans-Medium Travel** - Air, water, space
5. **Anti-Gravity** - Defying gravitational force
