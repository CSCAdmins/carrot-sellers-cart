## Official Responses

**Pentagon/AARO (Sue Gough, spokesperson)**:
> "To date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of any extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently."

**Gen. Mark Milley (Chairman, Joint Chiefs - August 2023)**:
> Never encountered evidence verifying claims regarding "quote-unquote 'aliens' or that there's some sort of cover-up program."

**Sean Kirkpatrick (former AARO Director)**:
> Stated Grusch "refused to speak with AARO" and suggested claims "derive from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosures of legitimate U.S. programs... that have nothing to do with extraterrestrial issues."
