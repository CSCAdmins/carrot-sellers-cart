## Background

Award-winning investigative journalist who transitioned from mainstream reporting to UFO/UAP investigations around 2020-2021. Former correspondent for 60 Minutes Australia and Sunday Night. Co-hosts "Need To Know" podcast with Bryce Zabel. Author of "In Plain Sight" (2021).

**Controversy:** In 2018, briefly worked as PR for Ben Roberts-Smith, later confirmed war criminal. Previously made reporting errors, including 1994 claims about Australian intelligence files found to be "skewed towards the false."

## Red Flags

- **Lack of Verifiable Evidence**: Claims depend on secret knowledge and anonymous testimony. Australian Skeptics awarded 2023 "Bent Spoon" prize for "unsubstantiated hearsay."
- **Uncorrected Errors**: Grusch "intel leak" was public FOIA; Ben Roberts-Smith PR; 1994 intel claims "skewed towards false"
- **Conspiratorial Framing**: Assumes dramatic covert explanations over mundane ones
- **Financial Incentives**: UFO topic revitalized career through book sales and TV ratings

## Positive Indicators

- Strong journalistic background (Walkley Awards, Logie)
- High-level source access (Elizondo, Grusch, senators)
- Advocates for official transparency, not perpetuating mysteries
- No known fraud or deliberate fabrication

## Updates

- **Aug 2023**: NewsNation issued correction on intel leak claim
- **Dec 2023**: Australian Skeptics "Bent Spoon" prize
- **2024**: Continued advocacy for UAP disclosure legislation
