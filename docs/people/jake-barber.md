## Background

**Verified Service**: U.S. Air Force veteran (late 1990s enlistment). Aerospace mechanic at Pope Air Force Base (per NewsNation verification).

**Claimed Background**: NATO Top Secret clearance (Bosnia service). Claims recruitment into Air Force Combat Control pipeline, then reassigned as "airplane mechanic" as cover for covert intelligence work. Describes ~30 years serving in both official (enlisted) and unofficial (contractor) capacities. Skills claimed: helicopter pilot, freefall parachutist, expert marksman.

**Other Activities**: Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt Instructor; competed at Abu Dhabi Jiu-Jitsu Pro (2018).

**Credentials Dispute**: Critics note Combat Controllers don't receive "cover" AFSCs on DD-214 documents; no enlisted USAF helicopter pilots since Korean War era; CCT pipeline has 90-95% washout rate. No former CCT teammates have publicly corroborated service with Barber.

**Current**: Founder, Skywatcher (private UAP research initiative).

## Psionics & Consciousness Claims

Among the most controversial aspects of Barber's testimony:

- **Military Psionics Teams**: Claims government employs psychically gifted individuals to summon, communicate with, and "persuade UAP to land"
- **Summoning Process**: "It looks something like meditation"; psionics can mentally pilot craft and invite them to land as "donations"
- **Consciousness Interface**: "Consciousness itself is how you interact with and pilot the craft. If you want to have a relationship, you need to be channeling a loving energy."
- **August 2024 Skywatcher Operation**: Team allegedly used "psionic asset" to summon UAP; observer Fred Baker reportedly saw "classic lenticular-shape disk" and egg-shaped object
- **"The Angel"**: Claims he and his family repeatedly see "a UAP we call The Angel that shows up over the house. It has wings, is blue, and then it shoots into outer space."

---

## Health Effects Claims

Barber claims severe health effects from UAP exposure, reviewed by Stanford immunologist Dr. Garry Nolan:

- **Symptoms**: Complete hair loss (alopecia), skin sloughing from arms, severe heart murmur, hospitalization
- **Nolan's Assessment**: "The acute injuries were obviously severe. The report reads like a bit of a horror show. To me, the first thing that came to mind was [Barber] was exposed to some kind of radiation."
- **Team Affected**: Claims "everyone on my team got extremely sick" and four or five individuals developed similar symptoms "within a week or so after deployment"
- **Status**: Retired from military with service-related disability

---

## Official Responses

**AARO (Susan Gough, DoD Spokesperson)**:
> "AARO is aware of Barber's claims and is investigating them."

**Pentagon Standard Position**:
> "[DoD] has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently."

**Congressional Engagement**: Barber claims SCIF testimony to Senate Intelligence Committee, meetings with Senator Rubio's staff, and submitted data/reports to AARO under both Kirkpatrick and Kosloski.

---

## Skywatcher Organization

Following his public emergence, Barber founded Skywatcher, a privately-funded UAP research initiative:

**Key Personnel**:
- Jake Barber (Founder)
- James Fowler (Chief Engineer; designer of "dogwhistle" technology—device claimed to attract UAP)
- Fred Baker (Team member; overwatch during operations)

**Claims**:
- 100% success rate in "summoning the phenomenon" using dogwhistle device
- Documented nine different UAP shapes, including "jellyfish-shaped" object with tentacles
- Goal: Obtain "exotic material" for scientific study and provide undeniable public evidence
- Investigated 2024 New Jersey drone sightings on behalf of DoD/FBI task force

**Status (Late 2025)**: Per critics: "The regular updates stopped. The promised data releases never materialized. The documentary-style episodes that had built such anticipation simply ceased to appear." Project went silent without delivering promised evidence.
