## Our Mission

The Carrot Sellers tracker exists to bring transparency and accountability to the UFO/UAP discourse. In a field often clouded by speculation, misinformation, and sensationalism, we aim to:

- Document claims accurately and in context
- Track the reliability of prominent voices
- Provide fact-checking where possible
- Maintain an objective, evidence-based approach

## Why "Carrot Sellers"?

The name reflects our purpose: identifying who's "selling carrots" (peddling unsubstantiated claims) versus providing genuine insights into the UFO/UAP phenomenon. The more carrots someone has, the more BS they're selling.

## Methodology

### Inclusion Criteria
We track individuals who:
- Have significant public platforms
- Make specific, verifiable claims about UFOs/UAPs
- Influence public discourse on the topic
- Present themselves as authorities or insiders

### Quote Selection
We document:
- Direct quotes only (no paraphrasing)
- Specific claims that can be evaluated
- Predictions or announcements
- Major policy or factual assertions

### Fact-Checking Process
Each claim is evaluated as:
- **TRUE**: Independently verified
- **FALSE**: Demonstrably incorrect
- **UNVERIFIED**: Cannot be confirmed or denied with available information

### Carrot Meter Rating Methodology

Our scoring system evaluates five key criteria, each worth 0-1 carrots, for a total possible score of 5 carrots:

#### 📊 **Evidence Quality** (0-1 carrot)
**What we evaluate:**
- Source credibility and verification
- Use of peer-reviewed research vs. anecdotal claims
- Documentation and citation practices
- Reliance on insider claims vs. public information

**Scoring:**
- **0 carrots**: Consistently cites peer-reviewed sources, official documents, verified data with proper attribution
- **0.5 carrots**: Mix of credible sources with some speculation or unverified claims; occasional reliance on unverifiable sources
- **1 carrot**: Relies primarily on "trust me bro" sources, rumors, unverifiable insider information, or refuses to provide sources

#### 🔄 **Logical Consistency** (0-1 carrot)
**What we evaluate:**
- Consistency between past and present statements
- Response to contradictory evidence
- Goalpost shifting and rationalization
- Acknowledgment of changed positions
- Internal logic of claims and theories

**Scoring:**
- **0 carrots**: Maintains consistent positions, openly acknowledges and addresses contradictions, explains position changes with evidence
- **0.5 carrots**: Occasional contradictions or position changes with limited explanation; some goalpost shifting when challenged

#### 🔍 **Transparency** (0-1 carrot)
**What we evaluate:**
- Willingness to cite specific sources
- Admission of uncertainty and limitations

#### 📢 **Sensationalism** (0-1 carrot)
**What we evaluate:**
- Use of dramatic language and hyperbole
- Proportionality of claims to evidence
- Click-bait tendencies and attention-seeking

**Scoring:**
- **0 carrots**: Measured tone, appropriate caveats, claims proportional to evidence
- **0.5 carrots**: Sometimes dramatic but generally reasonable presentation

#### 💰 **Monetization Ethics** (0-1 carrot)
**What we evaluate:**
